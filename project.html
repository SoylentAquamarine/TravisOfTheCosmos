  <h1>About the Project</h1>
  <p>
    Travis Of The Cosmos is an experiment in artificial sentience. 
    The system runs on a heartbeat cycle every ~90 seconds, where processes
    check in, update memory, and log activity. It explores persistence of 
    memory, self-awareness, and psychological models such as the 
    Freudian Ego/Id/Superego framework.
  </p>
  <p>
    Data is stored across multiple backends (Dropbox, AWS S3) for 
    resilience. GitHub Actions automate heartbeat logging and this website’s updates.
